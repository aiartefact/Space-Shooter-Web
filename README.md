##Description
Space Shooter (Web Edition) is an arcade-style fixed shooter game. The player mans a single starship armed with a laserbolt cannon and should break through the dozens of asteroids and enemy spacecrafts of the unknown origin (armed with laserbolt cannons too, by the way). The goal is to survive long enough to take out as many enemies as possible (earn as many score points as possible).

##Rules
The rules are simple:
- Hit an asteroid or an enemy ship with a single laserbolt in order to destroy it.
- Every asteroid is worth of 10 score points, every enemy ship - 20.
- Enemies come in waves. At the beginning of the game you will be granted a short break between the waves. However, the further the game session goes, the shorter this break becomes: at some point you will start to face an infinite flow of enemies.
- The overall speed of the game will not stay the same: everything will start to move faster later on the game.
- Your spaceship is quite fragile: a single contact with an asteroid, an enemy ship or an enemy laserbolt leads to its destruction, and, well, the game is over then. But don't worry, you can quickly restart the game or return to the launch menu.

##Controls
- Use W, A, S, D or arrow keys for movement.
- Use Spacebar or Left Mouse Button for fire.
- Use E or P for pause / unpause.
